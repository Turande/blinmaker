# blinmaker
It's a program that you can make blins as you want in quantity. I watched his [Youtube](https://youtu.be/FMIZEfjYmtM?si=-uo1Ng08QEALcySF) video about four years ago. He made blinmaker in Java.

## Code
I coded in C and C++ but C++ has weird keywords like ```auto``` that many learnt C++ programmers knew it. It's a part of Modern C++ meaning C++ from 2011 to Today
