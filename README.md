### A C and C++ recreation Boris' Blinmaker

## Description
I recreate this based on his [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FMIZEfjYmtM?si=-uo1Ng08QEALcySF) video but in Java.
It remains the same as his original Java code.
## Code
I coded in C and C++ but C++ has weird keywords like ```auto``` that many learnt C++ programmers knew it. It's a part of Modern C++ meaning C++ from 2011 to Today.
